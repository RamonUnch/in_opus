JUST COPY The 'in_opus.dll' file in your Winamp "Plugin" directory,
usually: "C:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugin" (No additional files required).

You set options by writing in the winamp.ini file or in the in_opus.ini file
in the plugin directory see below the OPTIONS for more details.
Go read the CHANGELOG below for latest news...

=============================================================================
== PURPOSE                                                                 ==
=============================================================================
Opus is a quite new audio file format, very good for generic lossy
compression especially at low bitrates including voice.

I developed this plugin because I wanted to be able to play OPUS files
with Winamp 2, both on my Windows XP machine and an old Windows 98 SE,
That is still used for playing music and for retro gaming at my home.

I had to build myself the libraries because they include dependencies
that are not present on this old OS.

The plugin was tested and works fine on Windows 95/98SE/NT4/2000/XP/2003/7+.

There is a very good plugin that was already written by thinktink but
it only works for Winamp 5 and recent windows versions.

I provide this plugin for compatibility with old platforms. to my knowledge,
this is the only Opus player for Windows 9x. and some of you may still
use Winamp 2 for some reasons.

=============================================================================
== THIS PROGRAM IS BASED ON                                                ==
=============================================================================
libopus 1.5.2, * opusfile 0.12 (http://opus-codec.org/)
libogg 1.3.2 (http://xiph.org/ogg/)
Compiled using gcc 13.2, (MinGW64 / winlibs.com) on Windows Server 2003

=============================================================================
== FEATURES                                                                ==
=============================================================================
* Opens *.opus and *.opu files contained in an ogg stream (this is what opus
  files are supposed to be anyway) the extension has to be .opu or .opus.

* Opens HTTP OPUS Radio streams since v0.610, displays Shoutcast/Icecast
  server info on Alt+3 since v0.888. If the URL of an opus stream does not
  end with .opus extension, append ">.opus" without quotes at the end of
  the url before opening it with Winamp.

* Displays most standard Tags values (Title, Artist, Date... on Alt+3)
  In addition there is a panel at the bottom of the Tag dialog box,
  displaying the content of the "DESCRIPTION" tag, used by youtube-dl
  for the video comment when using the --add-metadata switch.

* Full replaygain support.

* Output at any rate from 1-192kHz, since v0.777,
  and using 8, 16, 24 or 32 bits per samples wince v0.892.

* Runs on Windows 95/98SE/NT4/2000/XP/2003/7/8/10/11, with Winamp 2.x, 5.x,
  WACUP and XMPlay 2.1+. You need XMPlay3.7+ to enable UNICODE_FILE.
  Finally the plugin was tested with MediaMonkey 3.2.5 and 4.1.29

* UNICODE filename support (v0.666+) under Windows NT4+ as well as UNICODE
  tags support (v0.555+).

=============================================================================
== LIMITATIONS                                                             ==
=============================================================================
I did not want to lose time so there are some limitations,
they may change in the future if I continue the project.

* No way to edit tags.

* UTF-8 is not really supported under Win9x; all tags are converted to
  the local codepage for display. Thus you will not have all the Unicode
  characters. Under NT the UTF-8 strings are converted to UTF-16 since 0.555.

* In the Winamp playlist only the filename/URL will be visible.
  Since v0.911 proper format will be shown in the PL on Winamp 5.x

=============================================================================
== CONFIGURATION OPTIONS (OPTIONAL, DO NOT BOTHER IF YOU ARE NOT SURE)     ==
=============================================================================
A set of options is provided. You can write them manually in "winamp.ini"
in the winamp program directory in the section [IN_OPUS].

You can also write them in the "in_opus.ini" in the Plugin directory since
version 0.888.

WRITING THOSE OPTION IS NOT NECESSARY. ALL OF THEM HAVE DEFAULT VALUES
THAT ARE SPECIFIED BELOW. ONLY WRITE THE OPTIONS THAT YOU WANT TO MODIFY
FROM THEIR DEFAULT VALUES.
                             ; Comment (cannot be put in the .ini file)
[IN_OPUS]
USE_REPLAY_GAIN=0            ; 0: Off 1: album 2: track 3: Auto, 4: Null
PRE_GAIN=0.0                 ; Pre-amplification gain in dB for files
RADIO_GAIN=-3.0              ; Pre-amplification gain in dB for RADIO
THREAD_PRIORITY=1            ; Decode priority 0: normal, 1: above normal...
USE_DITHERING=1              ; 1/0 enable/disable dithering (default 1)
TAGS_DISPLAY_MODE=3          ; 0: Raw, 1: ANSI, 2: Unicode, 3: Auto
TAGS_FONT=10 Times New Roman ; Font size   Font name to be used in InfoBox
UNICODE_FILE=2               ; 0/1/2, Off/On/Auto, Unicode filenames support
OUT_SAMPLERATE=48000         ; Sample rate used for output (48kHz default)
RESAMPLE_Q=2                 ; Resampling quality (0-4) 4 highest quality
OUT_BITS=16                  ; Bits per sample to output (default 16)
INTERNAL_VOLUME=0            ; 0/1 enable/disable internal volume handeling
TARGET_LUFS=-23              ; Loudness at which to play back (default -23)
OGGEXT_HACK=0                ; 1/0 Hack for .ogg extension on/off (default 0)
UNIFIED_DIALOG=1             ; Toggles Winamp 5.5+ unified dialog on Alt+3
INSTANT_BR=1                 ; Enables instant bitrate display (default 1)
FORMAT_TITLE=1               ; Uses "Artist - Title" format in the playlist

Set USE_REPLAY_GAIN=1 to use Album gain and set it to 2 for track gain,
or 0 to disable replay gain (default). You can set it to 3 to use auto-
matically Track gain in SHUFFLE mode and Album gain otherwise. Finally,
you can set it to 4 to disable even the Header gain, that otherwise will
always be applied as the norms specifies. This value is not recommended.
In other words:

USE_REPLAY_GAIN values are and mean:

0 -> Header gain Only (DEFAULT)
1 -> Album mode => Header gain + Album Gain
2 -> Track mode => Header gain + Track Gain
3 -> Automatic Track/Album mode depending on shuffle on/off
4 -> Raw signal, no header gain applied (not recommended).

The PRE_GAIN value is a preamplification factor in dB that is applied before
the gain. you should consider putting a negative value if you experience
clipping problems. A common value is -6dB (ultra safe, very rare clipping)
0 (default) is usually OK because the gain is almost always negative anyway.
You should use the same parameters with the others plugins.
If you are reading this, it means you know what you are doing anyway.
Note that since v0.777 this option only applies to FILES and not radio.

The RADIO_GAIN is same than PRE_GAIN but reserved to RADIO streams.
The default value is -3dB because many radio streams are wrongly encoded.

You can set the decode priority thread (default is 1, above normal) other
values are: -2: Lowest, -1: Below Normal; 0: Normal; 1: Above Normal; 2 High

Set USE_DITHERING to 0 if you want to disable dithering. Default behaviour
for all versions is to enable dithering. Disabling it may slightly decrease
sound quality but will speed up decoding. Useful if you have a slow CPU.

TAGS_DISPLAY_MODE. Set it to 0 to dump the raw utf8 string in the
dialog, hence the character 'é' will be displayed as 'Ã©', not very nice.
Set it to 1 to force the UTF8 -> ANSI conversion and set it to 2 to force
the Full Unicode support (UTF-8 -> UTF16). This requires NT. by default the
value is 3 meaning the program will automatically use full Unicode support
on NT and convert to ANSI on Win9x.

TAGS_FONT: You can specify a size (12 is the practical max) followed by the
font name. If the size is 0, the plugin resets to default (8 MS Sans serif).

UNICODE_FILE: If you use Winamp 5.3+ with Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/10
then set this value to 1 in order to enable UNICODE filenames support.
This is not possible with Winamp 2.x nor if you use Win9x. If you enable it
in those conditions the plugin WILL NOT LOAD, default is 2: Automatic you can
also set it to 0 to disable it. Finally it can be put in in_opus.ini, and in
winamp's folder winamp.ini file, not the user specific file because this
setting has to be read before the plugin is loaded.
Since version 0.911 You can set it to 3 for beter handeling of MediaMonkey.

OUT_SAMPLERATE permits to set a specific output sample rate. This can be
useful if your hardware cannot handle 48kHz, this can also be useful if
you want to use this plugin to convert opus files to 44100 Hz wave files.
Default value is 48000Hz which means no resampling.

RESAMPLE_Q is the resampling quality. It goes from 0 (low quality) to 4 (high
quality), note that 0 is already not bad, probably sufficient for listening.
The default value is 2 as it gives a good compromise between performance and
quality. Note that this value is useless unless you use resampling.

OUT_BITS is the sample size used for output, the default value is 16, but you
can set higher values (24 or 32) to have a slightly better quality if your
hardware supports it. Note that 8 bits (unsigned) is also supported.

INTERNAL_VOLUME when set to 1 (on) changes the volume bar behaviour in Winamp
which permits to adjust the volume before decoding, this is a way to manually
avoid clipping when it occurs. Note that there will a delay of 1-2s when
changing volume if you use this option (default value is 0: Off).

TARGET_LUFS will be used only when replay gain is enabled and replay gain
is available in the opus file. It sets the target loudness in dB from the
full scale loudness. The R128 standard specifies that what is written in the
opus file has to be -23 LUFs, But any value can be chosen for playback.
Most of you will probably want to use -18 LUFs which is the standard most
other players use including foobar2k and is 5dB louder than default.
Note: When changing this value, the replaygain info in the Alt+3 dialog box
will be displayed accordingly.
Note2: The -23 (default value) corresponds exactly to the behaviour of older
versions, prior to 0.888.

OGGEXT_HACK can be set to 1 to force via a hack the support for opus files
with the .ogg extension. Note that it will slightly slow down loading time
when file extension is .ogg (vorbis or opus). In general performances should
not be affected except maybe on a very slow drive. Default value is 0: Off.
Note: on version 0.911 this option has a bug, see changelog for details.

UNIFIED_DIALOG if set to 1 (default), then the unified dialog box for file
properties (like mp3 aac ogg...) that is available in Winamp 5.5+ will
be used instead of the intrenal dialog. If you prefer the internal dialog
like you have on Winamp2.x be sure to disable this option that is enabled
by default.

INSTANT_BR allows you to enable (1) or disable (0) instant bitrate display in
the winamp windows, default is enabled but you may prefer to see the average
bitrate that will be displayed when this option is set to zero.

FORMAT_TITLE Only applies to Winamp 2.x and allows you to enable "proper"
display of the playlist entry in the "Artist - Title" format. If you set
FORMAT_TITLE=0 then only the filename willbe displayed in the playmist.

== CHANGELOG                                                               ==
=============================================================================
== UPDATE 0.913 ==

* Updated to opus-1.5.2 and to libopusfile 0.12

* Fix radio not working on Windows NT 3.51

== UPDATE 0.912 ==

* NEW: Support was added for title formatting on Winamp 2.x. The plasylist
  will now display track as "Artist - Title" if the tags are avilable.
  If you prefer to see the filename only set FORMAT_TITLE=0 in the [IN_OPUS]
  section of the Winamp.ini file.

* Now on Winamp5.5+, the Unified tags dialog will be used by default.
  You can always set UNIFIED_DIALOG=0 if you prefer the old style.

* Fixed small potential memort leek.

* FIXED: Local codepage will be used for display in non when unicode is not
  available. Before I was always converting unicode->cp1252 which was wrong.

* FIXED: build options were improved inducing an even smaller dll file.

== UPDATE 0.911 ==

* FIXED: Now url streams should work with MediaMonkey.

* FIXED: The plugin should be compatible with MediaMonkey again. It will be
  in my test list from now, even though MediaMonkey 5 will have native opus
  support.

* NEW: Now the average bitrate can be displayed instead of the instant
  bitrate, set INSTANT_BR=0 in the [IN_OPUS] section of winamp.ini.

* NEW: An option was added to load files with .ogg extension. The option is
  not enabled by default because the plugin will have to open all the ogg
  files to check if they are opus files. Write OGGEXT_HACK=1 in the [IN_OPUS]
  section of the winamp.ini file if you want to enable it.
  Note1: In Winamp 5.x, there will be conflicts with the tags when you mix
  both king of .ogg files, this will lead to tags being not shown for
  the second type of file you load in the session. All files will play though.
  Note2: This is not an issue on Winamp 2.x.

* NEW: The playlist entry will display proper format under winamp 5.x, because
  the winampGetExtendedFileInfo function was implemented.

* NEW: Unified dialog on "Alt+3" can be enabled for Winamp 5.5+ now setting
  the UNIFIED_DIALOG=1 in the [IN_OPUS] section of the winamp.ini file.

== UPDATE 0.892 ==

This is mostly a bug-fix update. Most significantly I would say, is the fix
of long durations. Due to integer overflow, in theory the longest file that
can be played is 2^31 - 1 ms ie ~25 days. I came along a 27day recording,
and decided to fix the bug. Not that I think many of you will need that, but
it costs nothing to share right? The other addition is the support of 24b and
32b output, use the OUT_BITS option. So if you hardware supports 24 or 32b
output, go for it. However keep in mind tht the EQ shall work only for 16b
output on Winamp2.x and will work on 16 and 24b output on Winamp5.3+.

* UPDATE: Now using opusfile 0.12 (with modifications)

* NEW: Support for 8, 24 and 32 bits decoding resolution, the default is
  always 16b. Add the option OUT_BITS=value in the [IN_OPUS] section of
  your .ini file to use this option.

* FIXED: Now dithering is applied even when resampling is used. Note that
  It is not very useful as resampling error tends to make bigger artefacts
  than quantization error. In addition, noise-shaping will be used only for
  16b:48kHz outpt mode, which is the default since the first version.

* FIXED: Now the user's session winamp.ini file will be read. This concerns
  Winamp 5.11+, and when the 'paths.ini' file is in winamp's directory.

* FIXED: Now WACUP users should have Unicode filename enabled by default.

* FIXED: Crash in some conditions. Now the plugin is compatible with XMPlay,
  this is not really useful because of XMPlay's native support for opus.
  However this can fix problems people experienced in some cases with Winamp.

* FIXED: Unnecessary bloat to the dll removed using gcc's -flto option.

* FIXED: The 24 days 20 h 31 min 24 s and 647 ms maximum duration bug.
  Actually, for any length greater than that, time will be displayed in
  hrs:min instead of min:sec format, this applies when jumping in the file
  with Ctrl+J option as well. Now the new limit for track time is thus 60x
  greater hence: 4 years 1 month 1 days 7 h 23 min 38 s and 820 ms.
  Yep u can laugh.
  Note1: the [h:min] flag will be added at the end of the playlist name.
  Note2: Visualisation will look wrong in this context.

* FIXED: Possible memory leaks.

* FIXED: Problem in the resampling code that would lead to NULL output in
  some cases. This should cure random 'not working' when using resampling.

* FIXED: Now the error code will no longer be automatically displayed in
  the PL for the URL streams, because it does causes performances problems.
  The error details will still be displayed in the Info dialog on "Alt+3".

== UPDATE 0.888 ==

This is again a recommended update because it fixes a major interference bug
that might prevent other plugins to load URL streams.

* NEW: Error message will be displayed in the PL when a stream is offline,
  invalid, has a bad header, etc.

* NEW: Added Shoutcast/Icecast server info in the info dialog Box (Alt+3).
  In addition proper error will be displayed in the playlist when a radio
  stream is offline or if it is not an opus stream.

* NEW: Added TARGET_LUFS config variable so that you can decide the target
  loudness at which to play opus files when RG info is available and RG is
  enabled.

* NEW: the plugin will also read the in_opus.ini config file in the plugin
  directory prior to the winamp.ini. If you write options in both files,
  the ones in winamp.ini will dominate when the concerned option is the same,
  otherwise all parameters will be read.

* FIXED: now the plugin should no longer risk to interact with other radio
  streams that he cannot handle. This implies that if the url does not end
  with .opus the plugin will not try to load the url.

  NOTE: If you have an opus stream that does not end with .opus, append
  the string ">.opus" or "?.opus" at the end of URL in order to force
  in_opus to load it.
  eg: "http://ivyrd.wtju.net:8000/wtju-opus-256.ogg" is actually an opus
  stream even though it ends with .ogg (like ogg vorbis file)
  use: http://ivyrd.wtju.net:8000/wtju-opus-256.ogg>.opus to play it.
  In the rare case a radio streams ends with .opus but is not an opus stream,
  add "?.mp3" or "?.aac" to avoid in_opus try and open it.
  eg: http://nebula.shoutca.st:8751/aac320.opus is actually an aac stream,
  use: http://nebula.shoutca.st:8751/aac320.opus?.aac to play it
  eg2: http://radioilusion.es:8000/radioilusion.opus actually an ogg stream
  use: http://radioilusion.es:8000/radioilusion.opus?.ogg to play it

== UPDATE 0.777 ==

CHRISTMAS RELEASE...

* NEW: added an internal volume option, set INTERNAL_VOLUME=1 to enable. In
  this case the volume slider in winamp will adjust volume before decoding,
  this has some use if you want to manually avoid clipping while playing.
  With this option enabled the volume slider goes from -20dB to +0dB.

* NEW: Added resampling option, Now the output can be resampled at any
  sampling rate eg you can set 44100 Hz for compatibility with some old
  soundcards. Set the OUT_SAMPLERATE to the desired value in the [IN_OPUS]
  section of the winamp.ini file. You can also set the quality of resampling
  from 0 (low quality) to 4 (high quality with) the RESAMPLE_Q option.
  The default value is 2 as it already gives a good sound quality and higher
  values are much more CPU heavy. Up-sampling is also supported.

* NEW: PRE_GAIN is now reserved for files and RADIO_GAIN is used
  for radio streams, the default value for RADIO_GAIN is -3dB because
  I experienced a lot of clipping with the radio streams I listened to
  and -3dB is a good value in my opinion. If you want a specific RADIO_GAIN
  value, set it (in dB) in the winamp.ini file.

* NEW: added a value to USE_REPLAY_GAIN, set it to 4 to use the raw opus
  signal without the header gain. I do not recommend this option because the
  Header gain should always be applied, this value is here in case it is
  needed. eg: opus files with a completely broken Header gain.

* FIXED: invalid behaviour in reading .ini file in some conditions.

* FIXED: Now the PRE_GAIN is always applied, even when replay gain is
  disabled. this is useful if you have clipping problems and do not want
  to use replay gain, note that RADIO_GAIN is always applied when playing
  Radio streams.

* FIXED: Now the normal EQ (Winamp 4Front EQ) works on Winamp5.x with this
  plugin. It was a strange bug related to the Info display.

* FIXED: No more flickering of the menu-buttons at the bottom of the winamp
  playlist when playing opus file. Hopefully it should also fix the screen
  tearing some people experienced with previous versions.

== UPDATE 0.666 ==

This update is quite important as it enables UNICODE FILE NAME SUPPORT.
if you use winamp 5.3+ on Windows NT+. Normally you have nothing to do
as the default behaviour is to auto detect the proper conditions to enable
UNICODE filenames support.

This is also the "stable" release including RADIO STREAM SUPPORT.
Most of the work was to remove dependency to OpenSSL which is a pain
to build on windows especially on Win95. In addition OpenSSL is bloated
and unnecessary for my case as I never encountered HTTPS radio streams.

* NEW: Now you can enable support for UNICODE file names by adding the
  option UNICODE_FILE=1 in the [IN_OPUS] section of winamp.ini. You need
  Winamp 5.3 or greater AND windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/10. This option
  will not do anything under Windows 9x and plugin will fail to load
  if you are using a Winamp version smaller than 5.3 and enabled this option.
  set UNICODE_FILE=2 (default) to enable auto detection. Note that this
  detection is based on the "WHATSNEW.TXT" file in the Winamp directory.
  if the plugin cannot find the specified file it will assume no Unicode
  filenames. Finally set it to 0 if your system cannot handle UNICODE.

* NEW: Value added to the USE_REPLAY_GAIN option. Set it to 3 (Auto mode)
  and it will automatically pick the Album gain except when winamp is in
  Shuffle mode where it will chose the Track gain. This is very sensible
  in my opinion as the purpose of replay gain is to avoid volume changes
  between tracks. In this case if you listen to a full album, the volume
  between tracks will respect the original Album purpose and if you are
  randomly listening to tracks the individual track gain will be applied.

* FIXED: Now the plugin does not rely on Windows Socket 2 but is instead
  compatible with Windows Socket 1 that is included in Win95 by default.

* FIXED: Now the seek-bar is disabled in Radio mode.

* FIXED: Small change to the Info dialog box in the case of Radio streams.

== UPDATE 0.610 (open beta of beta) ==

* NEW: Added radio support. for the moment only http streams are supported.
  I release this version because I am not sure when I will have time to work
  more on the plugin (Hopefully soon). So keep an eye for Release.
  Of course any feedback will be welcome on this beta.

* NOTE: I could not test it at all on Win 9x as I am far from home.
  Theoretically it should work

== UPDATE 0.555 ==

* UPDATED: Now we use libopus 1.3.1 and libopusfile 0.11

* NEW: Added the option to disable dithering. Some people might prefer the
  the way it sounds and it does speed up decoding speed by 30-40%. Generally
  I would recommend to keep dithering enabled which was the behaviour of older
  releases. As usual do not specify a value in the .ini file if you want the
  default behaviour.

* FIXED: MinGW was generating improper code for windows 95. With some options
  checked, the plugin is now 95 compatible (Tested with Windows 95 OSR 2).

* FIXED: By default libopus does a lot of memory allocation on the stack,
  this is very prone to crash, the correct flag was passed to libopus-1.3.1
  to avoid excessive stack allocation. No performance decrease was observed.

* FIXED: The UTF-8 to ANSI conversion table was broken, now it seems correct.

* Small modification to the tag dialog to include more tags that I find
  useful. Labels and accelerators were added for all fields, press Alt+T
  to select Title, Alt+A for Artist, Alt+E for Description etc...

* NEW: Unicode is now supported under Windows NT OSes serie. Under Win98 you
  will still be limited to ANSI. An option was added to select the desired
  mode: TAGS_DISPLAY_MODE. Set it to 0 to dump the raw utf8 string in the
  dialog, hence the character 'é' will be displayed as 'Ã©', not very nice.
  Set it to 1 to force the UTF8 -> ANSI conversion and set it to 2 to force
  the Full Unicode support (UTF-8 -> UTF16). this requires NT. by default the
  value is 3 meaning the program will automatically use full Unicode support
  on NT and convert to ANSI on Win98.
  - NOTE: On NT4 you will not have all Unicode but only USC-2 characters.
          Date, Tracks numbers and URL are always assumed to be ASCII.

* NEW: You can now select the font you Want, just add the line in winamp.ini
  in the section [IN_OPUS]:
  TAGS_FONT=10 Times New Roman
  the first is the size of the font, default is "8 MS Sans serif" you can
  specify a size (12 is the practical max) followed by the font name.
  if the size is 0, the plugin resets to default (8 MS Sans serif).

== UPDATE 0.444 ==

* FIXED: A few bugs in reading tags.

* NEW: ReplayGain supported, it uses the standard R128 tag, in 256th of dB
there is no configuration box, if you want to enable replay gain, you have
to write it directly in the Winamp.ini file in winamp's directory.
If no parameters are written, no replay gain of any kind will be applied.
The plugin will not write anything into winamp.ini, you have to write those
options yourself and restart Winamp or go to the config dialog box of
in_opus, this will read the configuration, you will need to stop and start
playback again though.

Open "winamp.ini" with notepad and paste at the end the following 4 lines:

[IN_OPUS]
USE_REPLAY_GAIN=1
PRE_GAIN=0.0
THREAD_PRIORITY=1

to use Album gain, set USE_REPLAY_GAIN=1 and set it to 2 for track gain,
or 0 to disable replay gain.

the PRE_GAIN value is a preamplification factor in dB that is applied before
the gain. you should consider putting a negative value if you experience
clipping problems. A common value is -6dB (ultra safe, very rare clipping)
0 is usually OK because the gain is almost always negative anyway.
You should use the same parameters with the others plugins.
If you are reading this, it means you know what you are doing anyway.

You can set the decode priority thread (default is 1, above normal) other
values are: -2: Lowest, -1 Below Normal; 0 Normal; 1 Above Normal; 2 Higher
You can also try -15: Idle or +15: Real Time (not recommended)

Note: the tags name are R128_ALBUM_GAIN and R128_TRACK_GAIN,
      the value should be an ASCII string representing in decimal form
      a signed 16-interer value in 256th of dB.

      I found foobar2k directly modify the opus specific header gain meaning
      that it will adjust the gain, setting the Album tag value to 0 and the
      track with the correct relative value.
      This is quite strange but why not...

If you want you can change the default in_opus options, you can edit the dll
file with a hex editor. Search for the string:
"Out=48000, 2, 16 Uni=2, Gain=0, +0.0000, -3.0000, -23, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0 "
"Times New Roman or other font with a super long name"
For in_opus.dll v0.913 (see old txt for previous versions).

The 1st value is the output samplerate (default 48000) in Hz.

The 2nd value is the Resampling quality from 0 to 4 (default 2).

The 3rd value sets the output sample resolution (8, 16, 24 or 32 bits/sample)

The 4th value sets Unicode filename support 0: Off 1: On 2: Auto

The 5th value (default 0) means 0: None, 1: Album, 2: Track, 3: Auto

The 6th value (default +0.0) is the preamp gain for FILES in dB.

The 7th value (default -3.0) is the preamp gain for RADIO in dB.

The 8th value is the target replay LUFS.

The 9th value (default 0) is to enable/disable internal volume.

The 10th value is the tag display mode (default 3) 0: raw utf8-dump,
1: force ansi conversion, 2 force UTF16 conversion (NT only) 3: Auto.

The 11th value is 1 or 0 to enable or disable dithering (default 1).

The 12th value is 1 or 0 to enable or disable .ogg file hack (default 0).

The 13th value is 1 or 0 to enable or disable unified tags dialog box.

The 14th value is 1 or 0 to enable or disable instant bitrate display.

The 15th value is 1 or 0 to enable or disable title formatting (Winamp 2.x).

The final value (invalid here) is the font size and the font name.

Do not forget to NULL terminate the string at the appropriate point,
just after the font name.
